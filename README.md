# A Supervised Approach for Sentiment Analysis and Language Identification
## Overview
   This project represents the culmination of a profound academic journey, marked by courage, willpower, patience, health, and divine blessings. Guided by the Almighty, this final year project has come to fruition, and I extend my heartfelt gratitude for the strength provided throughout this endeavor.
   It is a supervised machine learning-based algorithm designed for sentiment analysis and language identification. This tool allows you to analyze and categorize text data to determine sentiment and identify the language in which the text is written.
## Features
### Sentiment Analysis:
- Utilizes a custom-trained model loaded from the "Models/SA" directory.
- Allows users to input text and predicts whether the sentiment is positive or negative.
- Provides an option to show the step-by-step preprocessing of the input text.
### Language Detection:
- Loads a custom-trained model from the "Models/LD" directory.
- Enables users to input text and predicts the language of the input text from a predefined list.
- Offers an option to display the available languages supported by the model.
### Graphical User Interface (GUI):
- The application utilizes a custom GUI library (customtkinter) for creating graphical elements.
- Provides a clean and organized layout for a user-friendly experience.
- Supports an "About" window providing information about the project and its developer.
### Additional features
- Users can switch between different appearance modes (System, Light, Dark) using an option menu.
- Handles empty input scenarios gracefully.
